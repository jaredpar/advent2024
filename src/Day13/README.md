# Advent Of Code 2024 Day 13

Solution for [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/13)

This was a struggle for me as I have very little experience in linear algebra. Most of my time solving this was going through youtube videos to better understand Cramer's Rule and how to apply it to this problem.

Sketching out my notes:

AX = ButtonA X value
AY = ButtonA Y value
BX = ButtonB X value
BY = ButtonB Y value
GX = Goal X value
GY = Goal Y value
A = ButtonA Count
B = ButtonB Count

A(AX) + B(BX) = GX
A(AY) + B(BY) = GY
